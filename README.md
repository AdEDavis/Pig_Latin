# Pig Latin (v.1.0.0)

[UPDATE FEB. 2020: This revision of the software works fine and simply asks the user for input to translate. I am currently working on update v.1.1.0 which will allow the user to input a file on their computer and translate the entire document. The only issue I've found with v.1.0.0 is that it does not account for punctuation.]

This Pig Latin translator accounts for all possible words including the most commonly used compound words.

I abided by the rules given on the http://piglatin.org website. 
This software is more accurate than the translator provided on that website as their software does not account for compound words.

PIG LATIN GUIDLINES:
In words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word. Then
an "ay" is added, as in the following examples:
beast --> east-bay
dough --> ough-day
happy --> appy-hay
question --> estion-quay

In words that begin with vowel sounds or silent consonants,
the syllable "way" is simply added to the end of the word
Examples:
if --> if-way
another --> another-way

In compound words, each component word or syllable is transcribed separately.
Examples: 
birdhouse --> ird-bay-ouse-hay
mailman --> ail-may an-may
