# Pig_Latin
This is the most accurate Pig Latin translator on the internet. It accounts for all possible words including the most commonly used compound words.

I abided by the rules given on the http://piglatin.org website. 
This software is more accurate than the translator provided on that website as their software does not account for compound words.


PIG LATIN GUIDLINES:
In words that begin with consonant sounds,
the initial consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word,
and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:
beast ? east-bay
dough ? ough-day
happy ? appy-hay
question ? estion-quay
In words that begin with vowel sounds or silent consonants,
the syllable "way" is simply added to the end of the word.
In some variants, the syllable "ay" is added, without the "w" in front.
Sometimes the vowel will be moved and followed by the syllable "hay".
another? another-way or another-ay
if? if-way or if-ay

In compound words or words with two distinct syllables,
each component word or syllable is sometimes transcribed separately.
For example: birdhouse would be ird-bay-ouse-hay.
